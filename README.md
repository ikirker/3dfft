# 3dfft

This is some old code originally written for my MSc project on 3D FFT decompositions. It seemed to make an okay benchmark, so I exhumed it and put it here so I could put some polish on it.

The dissertation based on it is [here](http://static.ph.ed.ac.uk/dissertations/hpc-msc/2007-2008/Ian_Kirker.pdf).
